    # SevaAlert - Weather Alerts Bot



## Features
- Single Next.js server serving frontend and API route for OpenWeather.

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Run dev server:

```
npm run dev
```

The app will be at http://localhost:3000

## Notes
- The original app logic for pig/poultry guidance has been preserved and now runs on the client using data from the API route.
- Keep your API key secret â€” do not commit `.env.local`.
